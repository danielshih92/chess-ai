# chess-ai

I've been playing chess for a very long time, and ever since I started CS, I've always wanted to create a chess bot. I've finally done it ðŸ™ƒ.

Here's a video where I (white) get crushed by my bot (black) ðŸ˜‰.

## Playing against the AI! (Mac OS)
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/samliu21/chess-ai`. Navigate into the directory with `cd chess-ai`.
2. Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv .` and activate it with `source bin/activate`.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Navigate to the correct directory using `cd gui` and call `python main.py` to play!

## Data 
I used the official Lichess <a href="https://database.lichess.org">database</a>, which contained games in a standard PGN format. Here is the data cleaning process:

- Use `pgn-extract` to add FENs after each move
- Use a python script to extract the FENs
- Compare adjacent FENs to determine the played move in the current board position
- Extract the square that was moved out of and the square that was moved into

For more information, look at the `data_cleaning` folder.

## Failed Attempt
Initially, I tried to create a board evaluation neural network to pair with a minimax algorithm. There were two issues with this approach:

1. The evaluation network didn't perform to my expectations. It could detect material imbalances but couldn't detect simple checkmates.

2. Due to the large action space in chess, the minimax algorithm is very slow, even when optimzied with alpha-beta pruning.

Together, these factors prompted me to scrap this initial idea and try another.

## GUI
The GUI was hand-made using the `pygame` and `python-chess` modules.

## AI Architecture
This architecture was largely inspired by this <a href="http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2015/pdfs/ConvChess.pdf">Standford paper</a>.

The AI uses two models. They both receive a board position as input and output an `8x8` matrix of softmax probabilities. The "from model" predicts the square to be moved out of and the "to model" predicts the square to be moved into.

This approach is best illustrated with an example. Consider the starting board position and the move: `Nf3`. The evaluation of this move is the product of the value at the `g1` square of the from model and the value at the `f3` square of the to model.

Among all legal moves, the largest product is the selected move. 

The neural networks consist of six convolutional layers, followed by two affine layers and an output layer. A more detailed sketch of the architecture can be found below:
